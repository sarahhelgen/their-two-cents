# Their Two Cents

## Description

Duration: 2 week sprint

Created a recommendation management application, Their Two Cents, using React, Redux, and Redux Sagas. A user can login and view recommendations given to them by friends and family so they don't forget! Recommendations are organized by four categories: media, business, product, and other. There are additional views to add a recommendation by category and add some notes, as well as a favorites page so the user can save their favorite recommendations all in one place. Recommendations can also be deleted. I had alot of fun learning Material UI basics for this application as well.


## Prerequisites

You will need this software installed to run this project:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `their-two-cents` - information on database setup is available in the database.sql file. 

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`



## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`




## Deployment
